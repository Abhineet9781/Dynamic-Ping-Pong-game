A dynamic ping pong game is an interactive and fast-paced variation of the traditional table tennis sport. Typically, it is played on a rectangular table with a net dividing it into two equal halves. The game involves two players, each armed with a paddle, who try to score points by hitting a lightweight ball back and forth over the net.
